Idea 1:

Title: DEBOUNCING BUTTONS

Objective: To count the number of times the button is pressed accurately using verilog.

Motivation: Mechanical switches/buttons cause an unpredictable bounce in the signal when toggled. 
            Normally when a button is pressed a lot bouncing occurs which causes disturbances.
            Using debouncing buttons we generate pulse of period of the slow clock without bouncing as we expected. 
             
Implementation: Using RTL we are generating a single pulse when pressing a button on FPGA.

Functionality: Used mainly in arduino circuits. 
               Used in circuits where we have to count the number of time buttons is pressed.
               Used to generate pwm waves using pushbuttons.
 

Idea 2:

Title:  CLOCK DIVIDER

Objective: To implement clock divider using verilog.

Motivation: Used to divide reduce frequencies of clock(periodic) signals. Widely used in many circuits including counters.

Implementation: Using flip flops we can generate clock divider very easily. 

Functionality:  Used to divide/reduce frequencies of clock (periodic) signals.
