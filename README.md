Made use of Basys 3 FPGA Board ehich was programmed using Verilog language. <br/>
Also Xilinx software was used to code and run the same on FPGA board. <br/>
Alarm Clock has a faster clock speed along with am/pm mode and a 12 hour format for time.<br/>
Time is set in binary mode and the alarm goes off when set time is reached which is indicated by beeping of led display. <br/>
